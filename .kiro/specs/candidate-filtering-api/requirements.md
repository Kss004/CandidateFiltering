# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Candidate Filtering API is a FastAPI-based backend service that enables flexible filtering of candidate profiles based on various criteria including skills, education, experience, and contact information. The system must handle partial filter criteria gracefully, allowing users to specify any combination of filters without requiring all fields to be populated.

## Glossary

- **Candidate_Filter_API**: The FastAPI backend service that processes candidate filtering requests
- **Filter_Criteria**: The set of parameters used to filter candidates (skills, experience, education, etc.)
- **Mandatory_Skills**: Required technical skills that candidates must possess
- **Optional_Skills**: Preferred technical skills that are beneficial but not required
- **Experience_Range**: A numeric range specifying minimum and maximum years of experience
- **Partial_Filter**: A filter request where only some criteria are specified, with others left empty or null

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want to filter candidates using flexible criteria, so that I can find suitable candidates even when I don't have complete filter requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL maintain all existing functionality from the current implementation
2. WHEN a user submits filter criteria, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept any combination of populated and empty fields
3. WHEN filter criteria contain empty or null values, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL process the request without errors
4. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL return a standardized response format regardless of which fields are populated in the request
5. WHEN no filter criteria are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL return a valid empty filter structure
6. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL validate that experience ranges have logical min/max relationships when both are provided

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a recruiter, I want to specify multiple skills and educational criteria, so that I can find candidates with diverse backgrounds and skill sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN skills are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept multiple mandatory skills as an array
2. WHEN optional skills are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept multiple optional skills as an array
3. WHEN institution names are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept multiple institution names as an array
4. WHEN courses are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept multiple course names as an array
5. WHEN company names are provided, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL accept multiple company names as an array

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the API to have proper error handling and validation, so that I can integrate it reliably into larger applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data types are submitted, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL return appropriate HTTP 422 validation errors
2. WHEN experience minimum is greater than maximum, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL return a validation error
3. WHEN the API encounters internal errors, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL return appropriate HTTP 500 errors with meaningful messages
4. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL log all errors for debugging purposes
5. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL provide detailed error messages that help developers identify issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation and testing capabilities, so that I can understand and verify the API functionality before integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation accessible via web interface
2. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL include example requests and responses in the documentation
3. WHEN the API is deployed, THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
4. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL include comprehensive test coverage for all filtering scenarios
5. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL provide clear API versioning for future compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to be production-ready with proper configuration and monitoring, so that it can be deployed reliably in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL support configurable CORS settings for different deployment environments
2. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL include request/response logging for audit purposes
3. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL support environment-based configuration (development, staging, production)
4. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL include rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. THE Candidate_Filter_API SHALL provide metrics endpoints for monitoring system performance
